            <h2>My summer experience 2018:</h2>
            <p>The journey took us from the colonial streets of <span>Santo Domingo</span> to the beautiful beaches
                of
                the North Coast –<span>Santo Domingo Puerto Plata and Sosua </span>– stopping along the way to
                explore
                the off-beaten path towns.
                The Dominican Republic has so much to offer that my seven-day trip felt short. With breathtaking
                mountain scenery, vivid colonial streets, beach galore, valleys of lush tropical rainforests, and
                even
                arid semi-deserts, the Caribbean country has something for everybody!</p>

        <aside>
                <h1>On the continent</h1>
                <p>It wouldn’t be out of line to equate the eastern coast of the Dominican Republic as a sort
                    of sea and sun Disneyland – after all, it is here where the all-inclusive resorts snatch up
                    broad
                    swaths of cinematic beaches faster than the real estate agents can get the sun-soaked sands on
                    the market.
                    The beaches along the coastline from Punta Cana to El Macao rival those anywhere else in the
                    Caribbean, both in terms of their soft, white texture and their warm aquamarine waters.
                    Despite a lack of restraint on development in the area, the resorts and beaches here still
                    manage to
                    offer an idyllic Caribbean seascape for a seemingly endless crowd of sunseekers. </p>

                <h1>Islands</h1>
                <p>Tiny Catalina Island (Isla Catalina), just 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) off the Dominican
                    Republic’s mainland, is an idyllic sandy speck in the turquoise Caribbean waters. Known for its
                    well-populated coral reefs, Catalina is a peaceful respite for those looking to escape bustling
                    Punta Cana and La Romana.
                    The Basics
                    Catalina Island is home to a diverse ecosystem of sand dunes, mangroves, and reefs populated by
                    many species of sea birds and tropical fish. The island’s main draws are its white sandy
                    beaches and its beautiful underwater ecosystem. Snorkeling and scuba diving are particularly
                    good here, and the Wall and the Aquarium are two of the top dive sites. </p>

            <h1>In the city</h1>
            <p>Santo Domingo, or ‘La Capital’ as it’s typically called, is a collage of cultures and
                neighborhoods.
                It’s where the sounds of life – domino pieces slapped on tables, backfiring mufflers and horns
                from
                chaotic traffic, merengue and bachata blasting from corner stores – are most intense. At the
                heart
                of the city is the Zona Colonial, where you’ll find one of the oldest churches and the oldest
                surviving European fortress, among other New World firsts. Amid the cobblestone streets it
                would be
                easy to forget Santo Domingo is in the Caribbean. But this is an intensely urban city, home not
                only to colonial-era architecture, but also to hot clubs, vibrant cultural institutions and
                elegant
                restaurants. Santo Domingo somehow manages to embody the contradictions central to the
                Dominican
                experience: a living museum, a metropolis crossed with a seaside resort, and a business,
                political
                and media center with a laid-back, affable spirit. </p>

            <h3>Eat&Drinks</h3>
                <p>
                What do we eat and drinks?<br>
                Dominicans call their cuisine comida criolla and it’s a delicious – if often rather greasy – blend
                of
                Spanish, African and Taino elements, with interesting regional variants across the island. Dishes
                usually include rice and beans – referred to locally as la bandera dominicana (the Dominican flag)
                –
                using either habichuelas (red beans) or the tiny black peas known as morros. Most often the rice is
                supplemented with chicken either fried, grilled or served asopao (in a rich, soupy sauce).
                Invariably
                main courses come with plátanos (deep-fried green plantains), which locals often inundate with
                ketchup
                and a small coleslaw salad.<br>
                Mama Juana (or Mamajuana) is a drink from the Dominican Republic that is concocted by allowing rum,
                red
                wine, and honey to soak in a bottle with tree bark and herbs. The taste is similar to port wine and
                the
                color is a deep red.
